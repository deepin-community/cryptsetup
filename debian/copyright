  For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
  2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
  e. "Effective Technological Measures" means those measures that, in
  the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
  fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
  adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
 .
  f. "Exceptions and Limitations" means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
  any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
  applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
  g. "License Elements" means the license attributes listed in the name

  under this Public License.
 .
  k. "Share" means to provide material to the public by any means or

  dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
  available to the public including in ways that members of the public
  may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen
  by them.
 .
  l. "Sui Generis Database Rights" means rights other than copyright
  resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the

 .
  m. "You" means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
  under this Public License. "Your" has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 — Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
 .
   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
   Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
    and
 .
    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License
   does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
   conditions.
 .
   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
 .
   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
   authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
   formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
   modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees
   not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
   technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
   including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
   making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never
   produces Adapted Material.
 .
   5. Downstream recipients.
 .
    A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
    the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
    Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
    conditions of this Public License.
 .
    B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every
    recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
    offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
    Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You
    apply.
 .
    C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
    additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
    Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
    so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the
    Licensed Material.
 .
    D. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
    be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
    Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
    endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
    designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
    3(a)(1)(A)(i) .
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
   under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other
   similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the
   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by
   the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise
   the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
   License.
 .
   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
   royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
   directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
   waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
   the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 — License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
   You must:
 .
    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
    Licensed Material:
 .
     i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
     any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
     manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
     designated);
 .
     ii. a copyright notice;
 .
     iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
     iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
 .
     v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
     reasonably practicable;
 .
    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
    indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
    License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
    Public License.
 .
   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
   reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which
   You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to
   satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource
   that includes the required information.
 .
   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
   practicable.
 .
  b. ShareAlike.
 .
  In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a) , if You Share Adapted
  Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
   1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license
   with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA
   Compatible License.
 .
   2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
   Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any
   reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which
   You Share Adapted Material.
 .
   3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
   conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
   Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under
   the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 — Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
  extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
  the contents of the database;
 .
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
  contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights,
  then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but
  not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for
  purposes of Section 3(b) ; and
 .
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
  all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 — Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
  EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND
  AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
  CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY,
  OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
  ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR
  ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE
  DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS
  DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
  YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR
  OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
  CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES,
  OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED
  MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF
  LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT
  APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
  above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
  most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
  liability.
 .
 Section 6 — Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
  Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
  Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
  automatically.
 .
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
  Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it
   is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
 .
   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
   this Public License.
 .
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
  Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
  distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
  not terminate this Public License.
 .
  d. Sections 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 — Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
  terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
  Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent
  of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 — Interpretation.
 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
  not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
  on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made
  without permission under this Public License.
 .
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
  deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
  minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
  cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
  without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
  conditions.
 .
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
  failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
  Licensor.
 .
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
  a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
  apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of
  any jurisdiction or authority.
